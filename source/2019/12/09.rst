============


Summary
-----------
라이브러리 Documentation 작성 중 eigenvalue naming and rearrangement  problem 발견 후 수정 중(X,P). (Q,K,F,P) -> (N,K,P,X)
로깅을 이용한 디버깅 활성화 중 K Initializer optimization 진행.


What I did
-------------

.. _Kopt:


Optimization of K Initializer
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- library of xxzchain_ has several basis initializer when user want to see specific region of Hilbert space.
  I saw there is useless double for loop in code, so I make it single. In that process, I felt the code of saving is not pythonic but C-style code,
  I make it pythonic. See more detail at :ref:`optk`.

nbsphinx
~~~~~~~~~~~~

:ref:`Sphinx` is brilliant tool for documentation. Even though it provide great guide, a new tool have big problem which is hard to learn about it.
Especially, sphinx only recognize reStructuredtext(.rst) files for making html.

In that meaning, the library nbsphinx_ is a good solution. `nbsphnix` is *Jupyter Notebook Tools for Sphinx*.
Literally, `nbsphinx` helps me to make html source as `Jupyter notebook file format` (.ipynb).
It is not only support Markdown, inline comment and latex syntax, but also ***code excution*** that I plan to try it.
Thanks to `nbshpinx` , I can make page much more easier.

Todo
-------

xxzchain
~~~~~~~~~
- X, P initializer debugging and logging.
- SVD(entanglement entropy) and approx. unitary time evolution implementation needed. (Stack 2)

taxidata
~~~~~~~~~
한양대에서 제공한 함수에 대한 이해와 빠른 서포트(data)가 필요함. (Stack 2)

for this weekend
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- tutorials of `nbsphinx` .
